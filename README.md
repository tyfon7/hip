# Hideout In Progress

Contribute resources to hideout upgrades as you get them.

This mod for SPT adds a "Transfer Items" button to hideout construction/upgrade windows. Clicking this button will contribute any items in your stash towards the upgrade, and the UI will update to reflect the remaining resources required.

_I announced this mod and 6 hours later BSG announced their plans to implement this feature. Coincidence? You decide. Until they actually implement it, use this._

Some things to keep in mind:

-   Cash is not contributed early, and will be payed in full when you finally start the upgrade
-   Items contributed cannot be retrieved

### Technical details

Contributions are stored in the user profile data, in /SPT/user/profileData/PROFILE_ID/Tyfon.HideoutInProgress.json. Modifying that file is like modifying your profile - do so at your own risk. If you delete the file, your contributions will be gone and you'll need the original count of items to upgrade your hideout areas.
